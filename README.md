# Bamazon

(Homework 12 due Saturday 10/19/19)

## What is Bamazon?

Bamazon(Customer) is a Command Line Interface App that allows users to "purchase" some fake items as you would from a certain company that may or may not rhyme with Bamazon.

## Getting Started

1. Download Mysql Workbench to the applications folder of your computer

2. NPM dependencies:

- dotenv
- mysql
- inquirer
- table
- chalk

After pulling this folder to your computer -- To use Bamazon, please make sure to load all of your npm packages as listed above. We use Mysql to handle our database so please also download Mysql Workbench in order to run the .sql file in the folder. You will also need your own .env file to live in the folder, that will contain your own password to run mysql workbench as the root user. In the body of the .env file, you will write:

#mysql root
password=your-root password

(replacing the values after the "=" with your own).

## How to use

1. It's very easy to use Bamazon! Just run the app (node bamazonCustomer.js) from your command line and a list of all items we have for sale will appear.
2. Follow the prompts.
3. Make your selections by typing in numbers and hitting "return".
4. You will be prompted to buy something but don't worry - you will never be asked for payment information!

I think GoogleScreenCast using a port creates an error because when I run my bamazonCustomer and I'm not recording, I don't get an error (whereas I do in the video) This is what it lloks like:
